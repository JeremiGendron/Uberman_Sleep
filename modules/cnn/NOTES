Ensure that the number of samples for every nn can be sqrt'd evenly for 
even distribution

Still have no idea whether I can take 1D time-samples, make them 2D and 
run a Conv net on them; maybe I don't even need to 2D...
  The paper does mention that they flatten the input and concatenate the 
resulting pixel array with values from other images in an attempt to 
draw temporal relations between frames (exactly what I want).

I think a setup like described in the paper above warrants a try!




BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD!!! Massive failure, but very good experience :)

Maybe one day I will succeed.
