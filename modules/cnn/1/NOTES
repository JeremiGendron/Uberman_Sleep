I have found (this)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5779535/].

The page provides data and labels for binary classification with a 
time-series based on heart-rate, so I can test whether the network is 
properly setup and tune some parameters to my liking.

If you want to read the original data used, either download it from the website
or extract the tar.gz archive in the data/ folder in this directory.
