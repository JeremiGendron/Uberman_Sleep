Here I'll just mount a simple logistic regression DNN.

The input vector might look like: (m, (ema1, hrvema1, ema2, hrvema2, etc.), 1)

m = training examples
emaX = exponential moving average of heart rate at given resolution
hrvema1 = ema of heart rate variability at given resolution
switch = user is trying to sleep

this might not be able to predict when the sleep will happen, but might 
be able to estimate it accurately while the user is sleeping, which is 
enough for the application.
